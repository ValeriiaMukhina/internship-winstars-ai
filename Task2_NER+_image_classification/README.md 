# Animal Detection Pipeline

This project implements a machine learning pipeline that combines Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Image Classification to verify if an animal mentioned in a text is present in an image.

## Task Description

The pipeline consists of two models responsible for different tasks:
1. **NER Model**: Extracts animal names from text messages
2. **Image Classification Model**: Identifies animals in images

The main goal is to understand what the user is asking (NLP) and check if they are correct (Computer Vision).


## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the Animals-10 dataset (or use your own dataset)


## Model Architecture

The image classification model uses a VGG16 architecture pretrained on ImageNet with a custom classifier:
- Base model: VGG16 (pretrained)
- Custom classifier:
  - Flatten layer
  - Dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation
  - Output layer with 10 units and softmax activation

The NER component uses spaCy as a placeholder, but in a full implementation would use a transformer-based model for entity extraction.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the Animals-10 dataset, which contains 10 classes of animals:
- Dog
- Horse
- Elephant
- Butterfly
- Chicken
- Cat
- Cow
- Sheep
- Squirrel
- Spider

## Demo

See `demo.ipynb` for a complete demonstration of the pipeline.
